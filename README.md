## Resume template 

Might as well write your resume in HTML because you suck at MS Office. Face it, you don't know how to make any cool stuff 
on Word. 

The idea is to write & style your resume in HTML/CSS then use a program like wkhtmltopdf to generate a PDF. The template uses React so it will have to be bundled as a static site before generating the PDF. You can also keep a live version of your resume hosted online somewhere (Firebase?).
